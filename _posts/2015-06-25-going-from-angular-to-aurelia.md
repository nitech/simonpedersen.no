I've started experimenting with [Aurelia][1], the newest JavaScript [MV*][2] kid in town. Aurelia is created by [Rob Eisenberg][3], who has 10 years experience building frameworks. He worked on the [Angular][4] for a while, but ended up being known as *[the guy who quit Google][5]. * I had the privilege of speaking with Rob at [NDC 2015][6] before [his talk on Aurelia][7], and I got a good impression of Aurelia. Rob also spoke well of his former work place at the Angular team, which speaks of character. [At work][8] we started experimenting with Angular for rebuilding our dinosaur PowerBuilder software for the modern web as a [SPA][9] and we recently finished a prototype that uses Angular 1.4 and ASP.Net MVC. We made some conclusions: 
*   Angular has a beautiful logo
*   Angular 1.4 is not (!==) Angular 2.0. The latter is a complete rewrite
*   Angular has a steep learning curve
*   Angular has quite vast and broad support in the community

## Aurelia So you want to learn Aurelia too? Aurelia wants to stay as close to the standards as possible. It's written with JavaScript, so it lets you wirite ECMAScript 6 and 7 (using a 

[transpiler lilke BabelJs][10]) and it tries to stay out of the way so your code is not saturated with the framework's opinions so much. Start with the following two videos, which I find to be companions as one speaks of ECHMAScript 6 and 7 and the other is an introduction to Aurelia. 
### Rob speaking about ES6 at NDC 2015 https://vimeo.com/131191237 

### Rob speaking about Aurelia at NDC 2015 https://vimeo.com/131641012 

### Getting started Then head on to the 

[getting started section of aurelia.io][11] and go through the tutorial. Also watch the introduction video at the front page of aurelia.io. 
## Update Also have a look at this Aurelia blog post that compares Angular 2.0 code to Aurelia code:
