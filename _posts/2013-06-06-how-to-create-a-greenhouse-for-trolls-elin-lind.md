# <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">Elin Lind at NAV owns the first governmental Facebook page that has ever had success. During <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23socialarctic&src=typd">Social Arctic 2013</a> she shared the recipe on how to create a greenhouse for trolls and how to become the most popular Facebook page in the country. </span>

> In 2009, NAV tried to establish a Facebook page with the strategy "let's just jump into it". It became a green house for trolls. I believe the success of our current social strategy lies in the difference between the old and the new Facebook page. - Elin Lind, NAV Elin started from scratch, this time with a strategy, and created a page for paternity pay, which was by far the most discussed topic in social media. Everyone who has children - you'll understand. 
> We use most time to give answer requests. We don't really push information. Without any hidden agenda, we simply provide service.
## The plan is everything Since the first approach of "fingers crossed" did not work, Elin established a social strategy for the paternity pay page, containing some of the following keywords: 

*   Language policy
*   When and how to delete posts
*   Dialogue vs Information: Talk with, not to the user.

## Niche vs the monster organization We have almost three million customers. Creating one Facebook page for this amount of users is very hard. Therefore we decided to focus the attention on paternity pay. Internet is all about niche. Don't believe me? Read

## It's all about people   As 

[Cecilie TS said][2], let the user have speak with people that can talk with the user from their heart, rather than letting the communication advisor own the dialogue.
