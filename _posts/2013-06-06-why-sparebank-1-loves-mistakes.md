> "Why not tell that we also make mistakes? I love negative news! Whenever one of our 6 000 employees does something wrong, I rejoice. It shows that there are people behind the logo. People don't care about Sparebank 1 - but they care about people. <p style="text-align: right;">

## Negative is positive "A few years ago, we dreaded telling about the many phishing mails. Now we proactively tell the users about these threats before they manifest in full. Banks are no longer only a bank, but a media house. Big newspapers like VG read our blogs to get information for their articles. The old communication strategy is dead." 

## Sharing The younger employees work totally different from most of the old work force, that hold unto the accumulated knowledge. The new generation love to share their knowledge. Give them freedom to share. They are royal. Treat them thus. 

## Ask the customer for help Thank you for engaging, thank you for participating. Instead of denying the employees access to the social dialogue, we establish guidelines for how and what to talk with the users about. 

## Why Sparebank 1 is the best bank What is the difference between Sparebank 1 and all the other banks? Nada. The difference is in the people and how they relate to the customers, which again concludes with the same as Elin Lind in NAV and Cecilie TS: It's about people.
