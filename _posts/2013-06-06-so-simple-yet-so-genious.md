# Cecilie TS Four years ago, Cecilie TS had never touched Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. No wonder, really. Since Instagram didn't exist then. She uses four keywords to tell her tale on how to relate digitally: text, timing, presence and time. 

## Personal relation We are all humans (right?) Customers are people too. They want to speak to someone human, genuine. When texting on G+, Facebook or what more social services to be born, let your communication be genuine, not synthetic, dyed in your strategy, rather than copy-pasted from a document. Why do people follow my Facebook page? Likes are good, but we want to know about your backstage life. Even if people follow your company's logo over time, they really want to know who you are, how you think, what you drink and perhaps the color of your eyes. 

## Fun Humor engages. Let it be - yeah you guessed it - genuine, not put on. If you are a funny-bunny by birth, use the humor to draw attention. If not, don't try. People will realize you've been bluffing when they meet you in real life. 

## Presence People want to be seen. If they're not visible in your eyes, they won't believe you. Building relations take time. Build relations rather than spewing out information. 

## You will fail Sooner or later, things will go wrong. You will end up hurting or disappointing one or another. One of your employees will post something one late Saturday night - that should not have been posted. No wonder. You are human, right? Ask for forgiveness, that's human. 

## How to succeed in social medias People who succeed in social medias are people who see other people, as humans.
