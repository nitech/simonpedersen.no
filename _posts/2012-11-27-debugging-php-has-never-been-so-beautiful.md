Well, in fact, to me, debugging PHP has been an ugly mess. I know this probably is because I just think I know how to program PHP. Really good programmers interpret the feeling of the server by holding their hand over the screen and analyzing the heat pattern that emits from the irritated pixels. But to us normal, deadly developers, we need help. Help is found at [www.phperror.net][1], a simple class that outputs beautiful error messages. Not only beautiful, but also very, very informative. Play the video, download the class, and become a happy debugger!
