> Customers seldom attack the company regarding their social strategy. They complain about your bad trains, bad customer service or your meanness in general. Social Media amplifies the customer's voice. - Arnt Christian Scheele
## Train wrecks Digital productions used to be an add-on to the general campaign, ending up not exploiting the strengths of digital media, but as a half product. Though this is changing, the same trend is present for social media: 5 % of the budget is used to create the social media product - at the end of the digital production. NSB had enormous problems with their local trains, and therefore also got a tsunami of complaints on their Facebook page - about their bad trains - not about their social strategy. If you are evil, creating a Facebook page won't make you less evil (NSB is not evil). Conclusion: If your train is wrecked, you need to fix the train.
