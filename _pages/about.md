Hello there. My name is Simon Pedersen. I'm a Christian, husband to a lovely wife and father of three wonderful kids. And I am passionate about web and most digital surfaces. I grew up in the south part of Norway, in a little ship-builder town called Fevik. When I was nine, we moved to what's known as the oil capital: Stavanger. My father said (numerous of times): You can do anything, there are no limits. He let me play with his 286 "laptop" (which still works btw) from I was eight - and that opened my eyes to programming and databases. I've learned that space crafts, oil rigs and computers - no matter how complicated - are made by regular people. Like you and me. I've worked with web since Classic ASP was experimental and I currently work together with a bunch of smart people at Reknes, doing full stack SPA with MVC.Net, [AngularJS][1] and [Aurelia][2]. This is my professional blog, where I write about subjects related to web development. I hope you can learn from what I've learned. Feel free to contact me at: [js]let twitterHandle = '@nitech'; let email = \`${ twitterHandle.substring(1) }@gmail.com\`; console.log(email); console.log(twitterHandle);[/js]
